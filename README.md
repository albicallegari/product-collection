## TEST Description
Build a basic product catalog with API endpoints for CRUD operations. This project will test the candidateâ€™s skills in using Next.js (use the version you like most) API routes, the app directory, and server-side rendering (SSR) with frontend rendering. It requires also the ability to create and manage a simple ApolloJS server to CRUD an entity.

### Requirements

1. Project Setup
- [X] Make sure to create a monorepo with both (server and nextJS) projects inside
- [X] Use the Next.js app directory for routing.
- [X] Use the package manager you prefer
2. Functionality
- [X] Product List Page:
    - [X] Display a list of products fetched from an API route.
    - [X] Use SSR to fetch the initial product list (to test server-side rendering).
    - [X] Allow users to delete products from the list.
- [X] Product Details Page:
    - [X] Display detailed information about a single product.
    - [X] Fetch data via a dynamic route in the API (e.g., /api/products/[id])
- [X] Create Product Page:
    - [X] include a form to add a new product with fields like name, description, and price.
- [X] Submit the form via a Mutation request using the server actions.
- [X] On submission, redirect back to the product list page.
- [X] API Endpoints:
    - [X] Store data in a simple in-memory array (no database required).
3. Tech Requirements
- [X] Use TypeScript.
- [X] Write clean, readable code with comments explaining logic where appropriate. 
4. Submission
- [X] Provide instructions on how to install and run the project.
- [X] Include a README with a brief project overview and descriptions of implemented routes and components.
5. Bonus point: We work with many merge requests, so knowing how to explain your work well means a lot to us.
- [ ] Create a small PR on your repo showing us the structure of your PR
